# Slang
## Slang is declarative transpiled general purpose language


# Before reading the code: This langauge was created for challenge with a friend, don't expect anything crazy out of it

Start by installing dependencies
```
npm i
```


Compile the compiler (ironic)
```
npx tsc
```


```
cd build/
```


```
node index.js inputfile.slg
```


Enjoy. (Idk why would you)
